# Session Log: 2026-02-24-design-robustness-severity

## Request
- Session ID: session-2026-02-24-03
- Selected work mode: design
- Task summary: add machine-checkable generality/no-hardcoding enforcement with rule severity levels.

## Planned Actions
- Files planned to change: toolkit policy + process guard + tests + docs, and project proposal/design/process docs/tests.
- Why these changes: prevent one-off/band-aid fixes by enforcing robustness evidence and static hardcoding checks.

## User Approval
- User approval status: yes
- User approval evidence: user message "yes" after design discussion.

## AI Settings Applied
- confirm_before_changes: true
- assumption_policy: ask_first
- process_enforcement_mode: strict

## Execution Log
- Failure observed: none
- Corrective change made: n/a
- Validation checks run: toolkit lint/tests, project lint/tests/process gate/control gate.

## Results and Feedback
- Feedback received: add mechanical protection against non-general and hardcoded fixes while keeping per-project strictness.
- Feedback applied: implemented policy-driven severity and static scan rules plus proposal evidence expansion.
