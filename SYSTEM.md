# System Control Model

Status: Draft scaffold created in Step 1. Full control architecture will be completed in Step 2.

This document will define:
- Sensors (CI, tests, lint, type checks)
- Controller behavior (measure, compare, correct, repeat)
- Actuators (code edits, config updates, dependency changes)
- Termination criteria (stable green state against `SPEC.md`)
